# Milestone Project 2 – Memory Game

## Description

A simple memory game where the user builds a sentence by remembering and repeating it. The game starts with one word and adds a new word each time the player gets it right.

## Background

I initially started a more complex project called **The Event Listener**, but due to time constraints, I shifted to a simpler idea and built this game from scratch. Both projects are linked in this repository for reference.

Most of the UX design and information structure were developed for **The Event Listener**, and are included here.

## Notes

- Minor HTML issues were fixed
- No issues with CSS, performance, or code logic

## Included

- `milestone-project2` – the memory game
- `the-event-listener` – the original, incomplete project
